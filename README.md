Peak Portfolio
=======

## This is an app to help the user manage their stock portfolio. This was completed as a group project on CodeClan's 16 week course. It is a full stack app built using JavaScript (without any additional framework). We used an external API to get up to data share prices, stored all transactions, the list of all companies and the daily portfolio value in a NoSQL database.

## Brief

## Shares App

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a minimal viable product (MVP) that uses the data to display her portfolio in useful ways so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

 - View total current value
 - View individual and total performance trends
 - Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio
 - Provide a chart of the current values in her portfolio
